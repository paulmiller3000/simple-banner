# Simple Maintenance Banner with React

This React app includes a component to display a banner when your app is running but otherwise under maintenance, or for any other use case.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`

This will display the following banner:
![Header Banner](../assets/simple-banner.png?raw=true)

* Customize the files in ./src/components/Banner as you see fit.

## Future Enhancements

* Move image and text to config file
* Add routine to show or hide banner
* Add routine to retrieve schedule from database, detect if current time falls within that schedule and, if so, display the banner
